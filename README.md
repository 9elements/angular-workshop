# Angular Counter Component

ðŸ“– This example is part of the **[free online book: Testing Angular â€“ A Guide to Robust Angular Applications
](https://testing-angular.com/)**. ðŸ“–

## Overview

This repository builds a simple counter with Angular in three ways:

- [CounterComponent](src/app/components/counter/): Counter that manages its own state. Has an Input and an Output.
- [ServiceCounterComponent](src/app/components/service-counter): Counter that stores the state in shared service.
- [NgRxCounterComponent](src/app/components/ngrx-counter): Counter that uses NgRx to manage the count and NgRx effects to persist them on the server.
